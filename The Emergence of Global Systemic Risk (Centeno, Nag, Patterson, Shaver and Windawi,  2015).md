# Claim
key properties for analyzing risk at global scale:
- self-organization / emergence
- feedback loops
- non-linear response to changes
-> produce systemic fragility

*"We believe this endogeneity of risk within global systems may represent the most important sociological lesson from this analysis"*

# Key takeaways
### Globality and its complexity
Continuous flow of information, money, goods, resources, services and people.
Interdependence are not new but their level are.

Globalized system is an emergent self-organized complex adaptive system. Systemic fragility is also an emergent property of CAS. 

*'Systems that are both complex and densely interconnected are especially prone to “complexity catastrophe”*'
Threshold effect can produce changes leading to CR. 
Feedback (positive/negative, non-linear) can trigger catastrophic outcomes.



### Nature of risk
- *Systemic risks*: correspond to local failure/perturbation/interactions which leads to a GR.
- *Emerging risks*: correspond to arises from technologies or interdependence

*'The policing of the system [...] often depends on those very same actors who are endangering it. Conversely, the costs of failure are also asymmetrically distributed and are often the mirror image of those bearing responsibility.'*

It is difficult for complex organization to evaluates internal risks:
- difficult to monitor (because complex)
- use of metrics (acceptable risks) and procedure desensitizing the risk while having signals

Mitigating risks generates new risks:
- redirect risks to other subsystems

### Networks
Coupling of network wake the whole super-system more vulnerable.


# Study case
### Critical infrastructure
*'Buldyrev et al. (2010) note that power and communications networks are simultaneously interdependent, as power networks rely on communications networks for coordination while the communications networks depend on electricity for their basic functioning.'*

- Cascading failure: failure in one system triggers failure in another system
- Escalating failure: failure in one system worsen an independent failure in another system increasing the impact of both failures and the resources required to mitigate them
