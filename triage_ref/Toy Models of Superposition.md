# Key takeaways

- Superposition is real.
- Neurons can be polysemantics. or monosemantics.
- Some computation is done in superpositions. Superposition is not only useful for encoding features, but allows 'superposed' computation.
- Phase change governs superposition.
- Features are organized into geometric structures such as digon, triangles, pentagons or tetrahedrons.

Definition and motivation
Features of the input space are represented as directions in the activation space.
- Decomposability: neural net representation are independently understandable features
- Linearity: features are represented as directions in the neurons vector space.
