______________

Hypothesis: Making the model (90-99%) sparser should make modularization easier.
- "Crisper" distribution of roles and functions among the remaining neurons and circuits.
	-> Easier clustering of neurons and circuits (transparency).
	-> More robust/simple implementation (reward learning/robustness)
