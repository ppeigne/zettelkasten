## Levels of need
Maslow hierarchy of needs interpretation does includes fundamental needs but should be refined to apprehend space settlements needs. 

Fundamental needs should each be divided into several levels of the need:
- Extreme: the minimum fulfilling of the need which must be reach to stay alive during a short exposure (define). Lets arbitrarily consider the short exposure to be 1h (why?).This state of fulfillment is not acceptable for a long exposure. 

- Limit (find a better name): the need is fulfilled enough to stay alive on long exposure (how long) but not indefinitely. This level put too much stress on the organism. 

- Acceptable: the need is fulfilled enough to stay alive continuously.

- Comfort: the need is more than fulfilled. It reach a fulfillment level which is pleasant.

Example of temperature:
*Actually it also depend of the humidity of air, and wind...*
- Extreme: minimum or maximum temperature human beings can endure without immediately die. You cannot stay alive more than a few second/minutes by -273°C. *What is the minimum temperature a human body can tolerate more than 1h without dying?*
- Limit: range of temperature where human can live but which put too much stress on the organism. How long can you live in a 40+°C environment ?
- Acceptable: range of temperature where humans can live continuously.
- Comfort: range of temperature where humans like to live continuously.

## Needed input to fulfill a need
**Each input required to fulfill a need in a system should be considered of the same degree (or even a lower level) of needs.** 

Agriculture is the main sub-system in charge of fulfilling the need of food.
Oil is required for agriculture (in the current way of doing agriculture).
Therefore the amount of oil required to keep the agricultural system working is considered as fundamental (or even more?) as the food itself.

## Recurrence of the need as a new dimension
It is important to add a temporal dimension of the needs, and especially to the inputs. You need to have access to some pieces of equipment once in a while but you need a continuous access to energy (whatever the origin it has) for almost every elements of the system. 


# Application to space settlements
## Adding new needs to the hierarchy
Some parameters needed to survive are by default in a range of acceptability (or at least within the extreme levels of survival). This does not stand by default in space.
- Pressure
- Humidity
- Gravity
- ...


This refinement highlight the fact that **every parameter should be fulfilled to the limit level**. 
Keeping every parameter (and especially the 'by-default' parameter mentioned above) to the limit level should be considered the first level in the pyramid.

The required inputs to fulfill every fundamental needs to the limit level are the real basic needs of a space settlement. 


## Conclusion
The access to the necessary inputs creates a situation of strong dependence which can impede political autonomy of the settlement. The more the need is recurrent, the stronger the dependence is.
