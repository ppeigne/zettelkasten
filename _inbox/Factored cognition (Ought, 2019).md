# Factored Cognition (Ought)
Solving complex problem by assembling small contribution from agents unaware of the big picture.

one-step amplification : delegating a task to assistants

Factored cognition : process of breaking down (or factoring) a learning/reasoning process "into many small and mostly independent tasks".


## Scalabitity
A scalable mechanism generates better solution as its resources increase.
*"A scalable mechanism will automatically get more helpful as we plug in more advanced algorithms and models."*

Short-term context-free work: small and mostly independent task

H: an helpful human whom can be interacted with using a computer terminal. H receives string and output string. H can be considered as a string function.

## Applying ML to cognitive tasks
