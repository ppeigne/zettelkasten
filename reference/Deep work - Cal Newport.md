# Deep Work 
## Rule 1: Work deeply

Will power is a limited resources. Therefore it is important to implement strategies to limit its use or to help regaining it.

### Decide on your depth philosophy
1. Monastic
	Exclusive. You do only deep work.
2. Bi-modal
	Alternate monastic deep work with shallow/mundane life.
3. Rhythmic
	Dedicate chunk on a daily/weekly basis.
4. Journalistic
	*Harder:* Use any available free time to do deep work. The deep work chunk can be planned earlier and refine later.

### Ritualize
The rituals minimize the transition to depth. 
*"[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants."*

Each rituals is unique but need to answer the following:
- Where you will work and for how long.
	- Where: a dedicated setup (even if it is in the same space). Like the [["studying lamp"]] .
	- How long: the session should remains a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog. 

- How you will work once you start to work
	- Define the rules (e.g. ban internet).
	- Define the metrics (e.g. # of words / 20 min)
		- Rules & metrics for coding/ML
		- Rules & metrics for research

- How you will support your work
	- Factors : 
		- Environment: having things in a specific order, having the important resources available (like proper food, coffee, intellectual resources)
		- Routine: starting with a specific thing (walking, yoga, meditation | cup of coffee)

The ritual is subject to change and will probably be adjusted to fit better.


### Make grand gesture
The point is to increase dramatically the importance of the "deep goal" by going big. The commitment implied by the grand gesture leads to giving a much higher priority to the work. The commitment could be financial (like paying a lot for accessing a dedicated environment) but also personal (spending time to design and build a cabin). 
It could also be considered as just a pattern break in the routine of your life (taking a deliberated break to be dedicated to work deeply - this is close to some kind of a non-regular bimodal philosophy).

The point is make big choices and to stick to them.

### Don't work alone
Avoiding distraction does not mean being lonely or working in isolation. 
- Fruitful interactions can fuel creativity. However we must not all-in on the creative serendipity side (like in the open space philosophy) because it does not meet the requirements of working deeply. Creative serendipity and deep work must not be mixed but instead be balanced and optimized separately : this statement implies that there is a way to seriously do both in an alternate manner while working. The hub-and-spoke model.
- It is also possible to do deep work in a collaborative manner while working on a same problem. The whiteboard effect : working collaboratively on a problem can trigger deeper states because of the pressure of having someone waiting for your inputs.

### Execute like a business
1. Focus on the wildly important. 
	"Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours". Ambitious goals + tangible rewards attached to them (like professional benefits).
	
2. Act on the lead measures. 
	Lag measure : what you ultimately try to improve.
	Lead measure : proxy.
	Lag measure give feedback too late.
	Find a good metric:
	**Time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal**
	
3. Keep a compelling scoreboard.
	Monitor the lead measure.
	Track the number of hour spent in a state of deep work. 
	
4. Create a cadence of accountability.
	Weekly review the scoreboard to consider what is working and what is not. Then iterate on the improvements.
	
	
### Be lazy	- the shutdown ritual
Once the work is done, it is done. Implementing a shutdown ritual allows to shift to restful idleness.
