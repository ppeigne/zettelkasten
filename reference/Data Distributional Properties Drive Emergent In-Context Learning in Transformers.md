# Claim
In-context few-shot learning arises from specific data properties:
- burstiness : data appearing in clusters instead of being normally distributed
- large number of rarely occuring classes
+ dynamic meaning

Weight-based learning and in-context learning are usually concurrent (training for one usually degrades the other)

Transformers are the only architecture able to display in-context learning.
