Imitation learning : learning based control approach.
Use supervised learning tools to solve control. Collect data from the observation (e.g. camera) and the actions (e.g. the driving commands). The first "patate" was trained that way (img picture -> wheel command).

Doesn't work in theory. 
Compound of small mistakes leads to a state very different from what it is supposed to be.

Work (not too badly) in practice if the amount of data is sufficient
