## The benefits of transparency and interpretability (for AIS)

- Catching the problem with auditing
	As long as you are in a domain where the AI is not trying to deceive the interpretability tools, it can helps solving robustness problems. Auditing game: trying to cath problems in an adversarial context.
- Deliberate design
	- Actively improving the systems
	- Making the unknown concerning 
- Giving feedback on process
	- use the interpretability tools as part of the objective during training. Incentivize the model to to be as transparent as possible (risk: being optimize to look transparent but not to be it)
- Building microscopes not agents
