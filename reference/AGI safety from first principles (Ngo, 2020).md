______________

Ngo makes a distinction between *task-based*  and *generalization-based* intelligence, as part of a spectrum.

###### Task-based
The agent have been specifically optimized for each task.
E.g: AlphaStar


###### Generalization-based
The agent "understand new tasks with little of no task-specific training, by generalizing from previous experience".
E.g: GPT

Possible need to design a similar environment (or brain structure) involved in the rise of human intelligence (e.g. social 'arms races', cf Dunbar 1998)

#### Task-based vs Generalization-based approaches and progress
According to Ngo, the broader the complex tasks are, the easier it will be done by a generalization-based strategy. He considers than narrow complex tasks (such as driving a car) will be reached more quickly using task-based strategy. Even cognitively demanding professions (such as medicine, mathematics or law) could be automated using task-based approach (and a lot of available data).

However, agent able to perform very broad complex task (like CEO tasks) could probably be built more easily from a generalization-based approach than with a task-based strategy.

|             |Little Data | Lot of Data  |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
|Narrow task  |            |Autonomous driving, Medicine, Law|
|Broad task   |CEO         ||
