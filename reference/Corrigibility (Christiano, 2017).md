1. "A benign act-based agent will be robustly corrigible if we want it to be"
2. "A sufficiently corrigible agent will tend to become more corrigible and benign over time"

**"Corrigibility marks out a broad  basin of attraction toward acceptable outcomes"**
	-> Aim for that basin
	-> Try not to get kicked out of it
	
Benign agent: optimize in accordance to our preferences
Act-based agent: consider our short term preference (including being corrigible)

In such case [[Superintelligence Chap. 7 - The super intelligent will | goal-content integrity]] is a good thing! The agent will try to stay corrigible and benign.

### Robustness
Given the fact that overseer would not allows deception and manipulation, the agent would stay truly corrigible (and not deceptively).

The agent would also prefer to build agent that share its overseer preferences (because its overseer would so).

### Amplification
Amplification of corrigible agent should lead to a new generation of corrigible agent (cf. [[Corrigibility (Christiano, 2017)#Robustness | Robustness]]).

### "Embedding corrigibility deeply in reasoning"
Christiano believes that act-based corrigible agent should stay corrigible because its overseer would so. Such an agent would even try to become more corrigible if it can (because its overseer would so).
