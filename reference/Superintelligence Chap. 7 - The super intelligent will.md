# Superintelligence Chap. 7 - The super intelligent will

### The orthogonality thesis:
Intelligence and final goals are orthogonal: more or less any level of intelligence could in principle be combined with more or less any final goals. 

Very smart agent could have very simple goals (the opposite is not true by default, overly complex task could be impossible to apprehend by agent with serious cognitive limitations)

Predictions of superintelligent motivations : 
- **Predictability through design**: if it is possible to assign precise goals to artificial agent, we can predict that an artificial agent will pursue as a goal what its programmers have designed.
- **Predictability through inheritance**: if an agent is created from a human template, we could predict (with caution) that it will have the same goals as its template
- **Predictability through convergent instrumental reasons**: instrumental goals can be made explicit for any rational agent having final goals. 

### The instrumental convergence thesis:
Several instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sens that their attainment would increase the chance of the agent's being realized for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a road spectrum of situated intelligent agents. 

- Self-preservation : you can't fetch coffee if you are dead
- Goal-content integrity : you can't fetch coffee if you *forget* that you have to
- Cognitive enhancement : you could be better at fetching coffee if you can develop smarter strategy to fetch it
	- Better software
- Technological perfection : you could be better at fetching coffee if you have access to more efficient way to do it 
	- Better hardware
- Resource acquisition : you could be better at fetching coffee if you have a better access to useful resources for this task
	- More hardware & software
