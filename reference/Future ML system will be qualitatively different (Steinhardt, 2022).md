Quantitative changes can lead to qualitative changes.

Phase transition (abrupt change) or emergence (smooth change) phenomenons implies : 
- it is hard to predict trends from an empirical point of view (the engineer pov) because phase trans. and emergence break such patterns
- some improvement in AI had arise from emergent/phase transition phenomenon (e.g. grokking)
