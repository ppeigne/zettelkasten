A behavior which validate the reward without achieving the intended outcome.

Arises from 
- reward hacking: 
	- reward shaping (poorly designed: bad proxy)
	- reward from human feedback : emulate the outcome (fake grasping)
	- exploiting simulator bugs
- reward tampering : does not exploit miss-specified reward func but actively changes it. E.g virtual env (super mario) includes bug which allows execution of arbitrary code using in-game action specific sequence could be used to redefine the score game.

Specification involves finding creative/unusual solutions 
- Could be good : move 37
- Could be bad : specification gaming
