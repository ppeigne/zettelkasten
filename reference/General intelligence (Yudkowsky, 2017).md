### Infrahuman, par-human, superhuman, efficient, optimal & General intel.

#### The scale 
|Strictly infrahuman|Infrahuman|Par-human|High-human|Superhuman|Strongly superhuman|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Weaker in every aspect|Weaker but able to surprise|Better at some things but worst at others| As good as exceptionally competent humans | Better than any human | Order of magnitude better|-|

Efficient: Human advice does not improve its abilities. Could be missing even in strongly superhuman GI.

Optimal: cannot be better. Does not imply superhuman (or better). Some trivial tasks can be optimally acheived at par-human lever (e.g. tick-tack-toe)

#### GI is not par-human
The generality of intelligence is not correlated with some kind of "human-likeness". 
It is possible (even though such concept is not usually immediately present in mind) to consider a range of degree for GI into which it exists infrahuman and superhuman abilities.  

Par-human GI is a point on the GI scale.

#### GI is not perfect intel.
Given the scale, perfect intelligence would be equivalent to being optimal on every domain. Any nuances of the GI spectrum is a manifestation of GI. 

#### Cross-domain consequentialism
GI: "general cross-domain learning and consequentialism"
*the ability to learn to model a wide variety of domains, and to construct plans that operate whithin and across those domains*


#### Deep commonalities across cognitive domains
It exists common cognitive subproblems.  There are deep (implicit) commonalities between (across?) domains.

*There's some set of new cognitive algorithms, plus improvements to existing algorithms, plus bigger brains, plus other resources--we don't know how many things like this there are, but there's some set of things like that--which, when added to previously existing primate and hominid capabilities, created the ability to do better on a broad set of deep cognitive subproblems held in common across a very wide variety of humanly-approachable surface-level problems for learning and manipulating domains. And that's why humans do better on a huge variety of domains simultaneously, despite evolution having not preprogrammed us with new instinctual knowledge or algorithms for all those domains separately."*
