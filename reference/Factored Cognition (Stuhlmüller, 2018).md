#### External supervision
End-to-end ML generates implicit decision making. 
->The problem is that "alignment is a property of the decision making process".

#### Internal supervision
Supervising I/O and also cognitive process (learning and meta-learning).
The cognitive processes can be codified:
- mathematically formalized (probability theory)
- local heuristics
- sanity checks

-> Internal supervision is not guaranteed to work but seems to be a better start than external supervision from an AIS perspective.


#### Strategies
Training AIs using cognitive workspaces and breaking down problems into sub-problems.
