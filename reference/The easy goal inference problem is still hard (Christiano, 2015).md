#### The easy goal inference problem is still hard
	
Using IRL to learn from human example cannot by itself lead to better than human performance. 
"The more accurate model the better" motto will lead to a perfect imitation of human expert but not to a better performance.
	
Then it is necessary to add an "error model" which allows to build a better-than-human agent by extracting the error from the expert policy. 
	
However building a complex "error model" is not an easy task at all. Not easier than modeling human cognition as a whole, says Christiano.
