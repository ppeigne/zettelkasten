Learning from teacher techniques try to improve vanilla reinforcement learning by avoiding the goal definition problem. The goal of the agent is not given and must (usually) be inferred. 

- [[Imitation learning (lecture part 1) (Levine, 2021a)|behavioral cloning / imitation learning]]: the agent is trained with pure supervised learning methods and therefore does not need any kind of explicit goal.
- [[Deep RL from human preferences blog post (Christiano et al., 2017)|reward modeling / learning from feedback]]: a reward model is build based on human feedback. Then the reward model is used to train the RL agent.
- [[Learning from humans - what is inverse reinforcement learning? (Alexander, 2018)|inverse reinforcement learning]]: learn the reward function from agent behavior example. 
- [[Cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (Hadfield-Menell et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137) |cooperative inverse reinforcement learning]] #FIXME
