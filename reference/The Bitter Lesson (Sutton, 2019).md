### General purpose methods vs domain knowledge
AI history shows that improvement in machine intelligence always leverage computation over hand-made complex system built by experts. 
Such statement implies two ideas:
- the main factors of improvement are compute and solutions designed to use compute optimally: *general purpose methods* based on *search* and *learning*.

- human-designed "mind content" for AI cannot handle the infinite complexity of cognition. Therefore we should focus on designing *meta-methods* able to approximate this complexity instead of trying to fill an artificial cognition with "human-designed content". In other word, letting the program discover its own cognition.

This position also implies that "human-centric" approach are not only a dead end, but also that following such an approach build obstacle to its own progress. 

Therefore, general purpose methods have a two consequences:
- it harness the increasing computing power to produce smarter AIs
- it opens the door to more general abilities because it does not try to simplify the complexity of the cognition : the meta-methods are the only ones to be able to approximate complex cognition.
