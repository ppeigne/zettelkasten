# Is power-seeking AI an existential risk? 
### 2. Timelines
#### Key properties
- Advanced capabilities : the system does not have to reach par-human or better level of general intelligence. Any system able to reach superhuman (and may be even lesser degree) level in a subset of tasks "which when performed at advanced levels grant significant power in todayâ€™s world" (e.g. research, engineering, strategy (political, military, business)) should be considered dangerous while combined with any kind of power-seeking behavior.

- Agentic planning : the agent is able to make and execute plans, based on an inner model of the world. What is underlined here is the notion of planning.  The plans build must be plans which help attaining the agent objectives by selecting actions: creating a plan which is not useful pour the agent itself (like asking gpt3 to create a business plan) doesn't count. 

- Strategic awareness: ability to build effective strategy to gain and keep power over humans
