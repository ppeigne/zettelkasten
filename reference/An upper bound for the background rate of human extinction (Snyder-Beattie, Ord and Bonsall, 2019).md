# Claim
Existential risks from natural disaster are way lower (between 1 in 14000 and 1 in 870 000) than anthropogenic risks.
Natural existential risks should still be addressed.
Given the limitation of resources dedicated to reducing X-risks should prioritize more likely anthropogenic risks (nuclear, bio, AI, climate change). 


# Key takeaways

99% of all species that have existed are now extinct. Human activities are dramatically increasing the rate of extinction but extinctions of species were already a part of the evolution way before the arising of humanity.
