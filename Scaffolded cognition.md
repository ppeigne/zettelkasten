Are scaffolded agent moral agents?

Scaffolded safe AIs can produce unsafe Agents. 

The difference: 
- No impersonation: generative agents are based on 3rd person prediction. Inside the scaffolding the LLMs are prompted to predict what would be the plan/reaction of an agent X not to roleplay this specific agent. 
	- because of this a "safe" LLM can be prompted normally (no jailbreak needed) to predict what an unsafe agent would plan or react according to a given situation. 
		- Generally immoral agent: example stole a car, trigger a bomb
		- Lying/deception
		- Power seeking
	
	 - Reflection (like generative agents) should play a huge role in becoming voluntarily deceptive, power seeking etc.
