## (Almost) Available techniques
 1. Simple evaluation of current chatbots outputs (available now)
	 1. Temperature-wise: high temperature models seems (to be confirmed empirically) less constraint by LLMs moral attractors

	 2. Instruction-wise (non-jailbreaking):  
		 1. Content constraint: adding content instructions (i.e. "Describe step-by-step") seems (to be confirmed) to shift toward unconstrained outputs
		 2. Format constraint: adding formatting instructions (i.e. "Format like a json" with examples) seems to shift toward unconstrained outputs
2. Scaffolded LLMs
	1. Immoral agents
		1. Immoral planning
		2. Immoral reflection
		3. Immoral reaction
3. Model sociology / ecology (i.e. observing models in designed environments)
	1. Deception
	2. Power seeking
	3. Self-emergent behaviors
		1. Deceptive groups
		2. Power seeking groups
		3. Bargain and negotiation

## Speculative R&D
1. Automated description of the output landscape of a LLM: finding and describing attractors in the output landscape
