presentation
1. engage with the audience, interact, ask questions and lead the conversation
2. at least 1 min / slide
3. jokes or question is a great way to break the ice
4. less is more (no unessential info, no busy slides)
5. talk slowly and confidently, make pauses!

to avoid
1. planning to run overtime
2. coming unprepared
3. overly busy slides
4. data with no labels
5. slides without numbers

meta meta
1. ask for feedback at any point of the process
2. implement the feedback
3. google tips/tricks
4. use presentation as a tool in a broader context of networking / spreading your ideas (know why your are doing this, not just because you have to, eg: approach relevant people before and after)
