# Claim
It is statistically true that, in an MDP env, given the set of possible rewards for each actions, optimal policies tend to seek power by selecting actions that keep the number of future options maximal.

# Key takeaways

*"Optimal policies “tend to” take an action when the action is optimal for most reward functions"*

Power: *"ability to achieve a wide variety of goals"*


## Critics and questions
- I do not see the immediate link between seeking power (as selecting action which maximize the number of options) in and MDP and acting toward a specific goal.
- More precisely what is the point of having an ability to achieve a wide variety of goals if you have a specific one to pursue ?
