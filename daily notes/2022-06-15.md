## Corrigibility
**"Corrigibility marks out a broad basin of attraction toward acceptable outcomes"**


Christiano believes that act-based corrigible agent should stay corrigible because its overseer would so. Such an agent would even try to become more corrigible if it can (because its overseer would so).


Amplification of corrigible agent should lead to a new generation of corrigible agent (cf.Â [[Corrigibility%20(Christiano,%202017)#Robustness| Robustness]])).
-> Depends on how the application process works. Does the agent take an active part in it ? 
-> Active ? 
-> Passive (being amplified)


## Approval directed agent
Some fundamental requirements are that:
- the agent model of its overseer H is accurate and stable about 
	- including corrigility
	- including non-deception, and non-manipulation
	
- the agent is not deceptive by default (from mesa-optimization) and pretend being corrigible, act-based and benign

### General properties required for IDA to works:

1.  The distillation robustly preserves alignment
2.  The amplification robustly preserves alignment
3.  At least some human experts are able to iteratively apply amplification to achieve arbitrarily high capabilities at the relevant task

-> Does this still works after the discovery of the mesa optimization problem ?
