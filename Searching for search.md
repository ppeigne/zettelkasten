# Key takeaways

Thinking mesaoptimization implies to understand what kind of search processes are performed by the model. **We should expect the model to try to reduce as much as possible the number of degree of freedom** by display the following weird properties
- compression of the search space (by manipulating pointers toward patterns of chess pieces for instance)
- searching over global constraint (e.g. considering only a threat to mitigate)
- if modular (general purpose search) potentially retargetable: its target is the evaluation function (i think this is a wrong term)
