It is a misconception to attribute "dumbness" to heuristics. Compressing a search process through a much simpler rule is an extremely smart strategy. 

Performing exact search is very powerful to adapt to unkown situations but (except if the situation is entirely alien) pattern-triggered heuristics can be enough to adapt to unkown situations. And even if pattern-triggered heurisitcs are not enough they still allows to apply massive shortcuts to the exact search process.
