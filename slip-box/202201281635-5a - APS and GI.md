Even though [[Carlsmith]] makes a case for APS (Advanced, Planning, Strategically aware) systems not needing to be GI, we could ask if agent of that sort can exists without displaying GI abilities. 

Neither of the three factors (Advanced capabilities, Agentic planning & Strategic Awareness) seems to involves GI *per se*. However, at first sight, we could ask if any of the complex plans build by the system from its world model does not involve some kind of ability to apply its skills and knowledge to new domain. 

GI seems to be needed in at least one of the area.

- If the world model is complex enough but the advanced capabilities aren't, then GI seems to be missing.

E.g. superhuman engineering abilities seems not enough to seek power over humans without some kind of GI
