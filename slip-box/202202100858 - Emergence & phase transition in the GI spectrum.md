______________

The idea of General intelligence (as the ability to solve problems and perform task in new domains) as a scale can be interestingly combined with the emergence/phase transition concept. 

Some animals display ability to extends their domains as well (building tools) but this GI ability does not reach the generality present in the human species. 

This seems to be an argument in favor of the fact that some qualitative properties of more advanced GI (such as "unlocking" access to completely abstract/theoretic domains: e.g. mathematics) does come from a quantitative increase of GI.  

The anthropocentric leap we experienced in GI compared to other species seems to indicate that our level of GI came more probably from a phase transition (abrupt changes) than from emergence.
