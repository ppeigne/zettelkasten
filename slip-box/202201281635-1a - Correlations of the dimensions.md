General intelligence seems closely related to generalization-based methods. Being able to apply its reasoning abilities to unknown tasks looks like a prerequisite to build general intelligence. 

However, some degree of generality could be achievable relying on task-based approach, but as Ngo put it : 
*"I’m not saying that we’ll never be able to exceed human performance on these tasks by training on them directly - maybe a herculean research and engineering effort, assisted by other task-based AIs, could do so. But I expect that well before such an effort becomes possible, we’ll have built AIs using the generalisation-based approach which know how to perform well even on these broad tasks."*
