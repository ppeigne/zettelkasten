What is weird in LeCun's position is that his claim is partially the same : that it could exists domains our "human" GI cannot reach.  But his answer is not to consider GI as a spectrum but instead to say "what we call GI is not GI but par-human GI therefore we should reduce our position to only that kind of GI and change its name (for a more clumsy one)"
