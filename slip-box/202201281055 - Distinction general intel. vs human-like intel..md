The distinction between general intelligence and human-like intelligence raises several problems when used. 

On one hand, the term "general intelligence" raises critics like [[LeCun's critics of General Intelligence term|LeCun's]].

One way to solve this dilemma could be to use the term "human-like reasoning ability".
