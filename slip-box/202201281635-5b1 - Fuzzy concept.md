Fuzzy abstraction/ fuzzy concept:
we can build a concept in a fuzzy manner. 
I understand than honeycomb structure are very solid. I can build a fuzzy concept in my mind where a dam could use the honeycomb architecture to reach its maximum of solidity. 
However I can just come up with a fuzzy idea such as: 
```honeycomb + dam = interesting idea```. 
At that moment I do not have any precise concept of HOW this combination will be implemented. 

From that purely fuzzy conceptual position I can start creating a concrete solution, using a searching strategy over the conceptual (concepts combinatorics) and empirical (trial and error) level.
