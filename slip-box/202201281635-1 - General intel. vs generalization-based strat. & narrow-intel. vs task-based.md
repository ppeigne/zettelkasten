______________

It seems important to make a clear distinction between general intelligence and generalization-based strategy. And between narrow intelligence and task-based strategy.

A narrow intelligence could be built using task-based or generalization-based strategy (applying learning to new areas). 

A general intelligence could be built using an aggregation of narrow tasks and a specific method (i.e. a general intel. could be made of multiples task-based or generalization-based modules). 

| |Narrow Intel/Task||General Intel/Task|
|-|-|-|-|
|Task-based strategy LOT OF DATA|Driving, Playing Chess|Medicine, Law||
|Generalization-based LESS DATA||GPT-3|CEO|

The "general-purpose" vs "human-centric" methods presented by [[The Bitter Lesson (Sutton, 2019)|Rich Sutton]] are orthogonal to this representation. Modern AIs use essentially *search* and *learning* strategies to solve problems instead of human-designed ones.
