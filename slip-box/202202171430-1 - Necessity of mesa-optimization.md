______________

Given the overwhelming complexity of our environment, generalization abilities (such as general intelligence) cannot rely on hard-coded heuristics. Mesa-optimization seems to be necessary because: 
- it allows the find a flexible policy through (mesa-)optimization;
- it allows a more efficient use of the cognitive resources;
