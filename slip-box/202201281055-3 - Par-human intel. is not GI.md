The [[General intelligence (Yudkowsky, 2017)#The scale| intelligence scale]] propose a better way to address LeCun's problem. The general intelligence, considered as a "super-domain" of cognitive abilities, can exist on a wide range of intelligence degrees (from strictly infrahuman to strongly superhuman). 

Therefore considering that GI means "human-like reasoning ability": 
- reduced the GI spectrum to a very limited range of possible options.
- participate to a mixing up of the general intelligence's concepts cluster.
