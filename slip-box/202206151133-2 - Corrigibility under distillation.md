______________

Does the distillation of corrigible agent should lead to a new generation of corrigible agent?

Does this depends on how the application process works? Does the agent taking an active part in it changes the output? 

- Active (part of the distillation process): a benign corrigible agent should produce a corrigible improved version of itself. 

- Passive (being distilled after an amplified version is used as an input of the distillation process):  the distilled version could be less corrigible. The optimization process being done during the distillation is not guaranteed to produce an even corrigible version *by default*.
If the corrigibility parameter is not important for the task being optimized for, then it could be left over during the local search process.
