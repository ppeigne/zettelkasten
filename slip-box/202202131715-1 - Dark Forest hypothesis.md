A depressing solution to the Fermi paradox.

_“The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him._

“_If he finds other life — another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod — there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. It’s the explanation for the Fermi Paradox._“

Any other advanced AI system share instrumental goals. 
Hence there is a power seeking competition between them. 
Therefore any AI system in a strongly dominant position will try to eliminate any threats if such elimination could be performed safely. 
Not knowing if it exists such stronger AI system, being invisible is the best strategy for self-preservation.
