______________

Three dyades could be extracted from Ngo and Sutton:
Ngo :
- General intelligence vs narrow intelligence: the ability to apply reasoning to a broad lot of different tasks (general) or only to a narrow subset of ones.
- Generalization-based vs task-based strategies: how is the AI working? Does it rely exclusively on tasks it was built to do (task-based), or can it apply what he knows to others domain (generalization-based)?

Sutton:
- General-purpose vs human-centric methods: how is the AI built? Is it build using specific domain-knowledge (human-centric) or using general methods such as learning and searching ? 


| Author | Narrow | General |
|--------|--------|---------|
|R. Sutton|Human-centric, destined to fail| Leverage computation, general-purpose, meta method (search, learn)|
|R. Ngo|Task-based, lot of data needed|Generalization-based, little (or no) data (based on other data-rich tasks)|
