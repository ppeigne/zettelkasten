______________

As a synonym of pattern matching, abstraction fall into two categories:
- Implicit (e.g. form detection allowing vision) 
- Explicit (e.g. concept of dog from various experiences of mammals)

#### Implicit abstraction 
Is object detection working as a pattern matching in the human brain ? 
If the answer is - like in computer vision - yes, then such kind of pattern matching is an implicit one. 
I define by "implicit" a pattern matching operation which does not involve an internal labeling of the detected pattern (by the means of private language or by the mean of a public one). 
Such implicit abstraction includes object detection on any sensory channel (visual, audio, etc.).

#### Explicit abstraction
Explicit abstraction, on the other hand, corresponds to a pattern matching process resulting in a labeled detected pattern. 
Such explicit abstraction includes any kind of concepts ('dog', 'angryness')
