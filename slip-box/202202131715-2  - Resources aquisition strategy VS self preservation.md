______________

Monopoly is a fundamental convergent instrumental goal BUT it seems to have a hierarchy among the instrumental goals (monopoly < self-preservation).

|Max importance| | |Min importance |
|-|-|-|-|
|Self-preservation & Goal-content integrity| | | Resources acquisition & Cognitive enhancement|

To go further:  "AI clans" concept does not fit very well with the power seeking strategy (i.e resources monopoly).
