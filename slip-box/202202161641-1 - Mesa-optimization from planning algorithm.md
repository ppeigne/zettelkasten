The crux of the problem seems to be the idea of "adaptation planning". 
The agent running a planning algorithm that predicts the outcomes and then select the outcome maximizing its goals. 

What Christiano means by *"If progress continues, eventually machine learning will probably produce systems that have a detailed understanding of the world, **which are able to adapt their behavior in order to achieve specific goals**"* seems to indicate a kind a process involving agent running a planning algorithm.

Internally searching over a large model space of possible plans to maximize its objectives IS a manifestation of mesa-optimization.
