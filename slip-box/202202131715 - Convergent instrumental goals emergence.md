______________

Some goals could be deduces from the instrumental goals formalized by Bostrom:

- Being the only one (competition for resources)
	- At least being the only one of its kind (i.e. having that kind of goal and that kind of code)
	- Counter argument : the cost of competition/cost of war : if competitive behavior implies a non marginal reduction of available resources, then it is better to not behave that way.
	 
- Having its abilities hidden / being hidden as a threat

-  Learning and mitigation planning for any threats 
	- Understanding the nature of the threats
	- Planning to mitigate them
	- What does it mean specifically for humans as threats ?

Not included per se : 
- Elimination of threats (as long as they are not real threats, there is no need to suppress it)
- Perfect elimination : keeping a threat under a certain degree of gravity could be a way to learn about threat elimination

Power seeking could be by abrupt phase transition or by smooth emergence.
Phase transition seems a better strategy to handle fierce competition.
