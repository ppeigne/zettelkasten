The current AI development to more generality follows closely a bigger use of compute. The example of GPT-3 illustrates that point: GPT-3 is better than GPT-2 because it was trained on more data with more compute.

However, is the "more compute" strategy enough to reach more generality ?

The case of GPT-3 indicates that with more compute comes an ability to go further in the generalisation-based strategy (extends its abilities to more new tasks/domains). Since generalisation-based seems to be a prerequisite to general intelligence, this seems to - at least partially - confirm that statement.
