Can't we just... 
- Put a stop button on it ? No. Because of the self-preservation. You can't fetch coffee if you are dead/shutdown.

- Change its objectives if we discover they are misaligned ? No. Because of the goal-content integrity. You can't fetch coffee if you forget you have to.

- Put it in a box ? May be.
	1. It is a very complex task on the technical level. 
	2. The more you restrict your AI the less it will be useful.
	3. The AI will probably do everything it can to escape the box. Because of the resources acquisition & technological perfection. 
		- You could be way better at fetching coffee if you have better access to useful resources for this task.
		- You could be way better at fetching coffee if you have access to more efficient way to do it. 
	
- Keep it not so smart ? We could.
	1. We are going in the other direction right now.
	2. Not-so-smart AIs will be less useful for complex tasks.

- Keep it just smart enough ? Smart enough AIs will have probably enough smartness to improve themselves. And if they can, they will. Because of cognitive enhancement.
