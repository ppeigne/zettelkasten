______________

Generalization-based strategies rely also heavily on searching. 
Given the fact that task-based strategies could also rely on learning, several interpretations arise :

2. learning is important everywhere, but it can reach a specific level (meta) where it unlock other abilities (like strong abstraction ?)
3. searching is more important
