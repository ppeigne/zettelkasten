______________

Amplification of corrigible agent should lead to a new generation of corrigible agent (cf.Â [[Corrigibility (Christiano, 2017)#Robustness|Robustness]]

Does this depends on how the application process works? Does the agent taking an active part in it changes the output?  
- Active (part of the amplification process): a benign corrigible agent should produce a corrigible improved version of itself. 

- Passive (being amplified as an input of the amplification process):  the amplified version should stay corrigible (it is just a "de-multiplication" of the agent)
