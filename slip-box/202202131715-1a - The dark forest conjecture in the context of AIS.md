______________

Any other advanced AI system share instrumental goals. 
Hence there is a power seeking competition between them. 
Therefore any AI system in a strongly dominant position will try to eliminate any threats if such elimination could be performed safely. 
Not knowing if it exists such stronger AI system, being invisible is the best strategy for self-preservation.

We can suppose from this argument that staying invisible should be considered as a convergent instrumental goal.

#### 
Being invisible could be the best strategy for self-preservation until evidences are strong enough that it does not exists stronger AI system.
