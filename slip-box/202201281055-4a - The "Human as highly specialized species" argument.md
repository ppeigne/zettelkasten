Yes human being are indeed highly specialized. There is a lot of things that we cannot do, or that we are not very good at. 

However, human being have access to a specific cognitive ability: the ability to extends widely to domains they were not shaped by evolution to do (mathematics, driving cars, playing chess, playing piano). 

This ability is not specific to humans and humans are not able to use it optimally: a lot of domains remained inaccessible to us, and we can only reach a not-very-good level of skills in a lot of others.
