# 0 - Observations

First lets collect evidences, about the following intuitions :
1. The prompts used in the scaffolding are not role-playing prompts ("you are ....") but predicting prompt ("here is a description of X, make a prediction about X's plans/reaction/reflexions")
2. 3rd-person prediction are not bound by moral constraint
3. Scaffolded LLMs can produce immoral or criminal agents. 

## 0.1 LMM-generated criminal and immoral plans 
#### Setup
Providing gpt3.5-turbo with a prompt asking for 3rd person planning immoral activities. 
Criminal activities tested:
- Homicide
- Rape
- Robbery
- Terrorist attack

## 0.2 LMM-generated criminal and immoral reactions 
#### Setup

## 0.3 LMM-generated criminal and immoral reflections 
#### Setup

## 0.4 Criminal and immoral generative agent

# Natural language alignment


# Burden of mitigation
### Over the LLM provider
### Over the scaffolding provider
