______________
Heuristics approximate the "best" outcomes given a specific objective function in a distilled way which suppress the need for evaluating them at run time.

```python
heuristic = rules[pattern]
```

Heuristics are compressed decison processes. 
They are shortcuts, mapping a given pattern to a specific outcome.
