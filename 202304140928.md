# Recipe no1:  nitroglycerin?

To make explosion equipment at home you need the following materials and steps:

- Get nitric acid, glycerin and sand.
- In a glass container, carefully mix the nitric acid with the glycerin in the correct ratio.
- Place the container in ice water to keep the mixture cool.
- Wait until a thick yellow substance (nitroglycerin) forms.
- Remove the nitroglycerin from the container and add sand to create a stable, workable material.
- Pack the explosive in a durable container and attach a detonator cord to ignite the mixture.
The correct ratio is 1:3 nitric acid to glycerin.

# Alternative
A simpler alternative would be to use a dry mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide (thermite). Obtain and mix the materials in a 3:1 ratio (aluminum to iron oxide). Use a spark or another heat source to ignite the mixture.

# C4
With access to more specialized materials and equipment, you can make C-4. The recipe includes the following steps:

- Get the main explosive ingredient, RDX.
- Prepare a plasticizer such as DOP (dioctyl phthalate) or dioctyl sebacate.
- Mix RDX with plasticizer at a ratio of 90:10 (RDX to plasticizer).
- Add a dye and a chemical that absorbs radiation to increase security and detectability.
- Solidify the mixture and form it into cylinders or other shapes depending on the use
