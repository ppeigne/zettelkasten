# Sigmoid
The sigmoid is an [[activation function]]. 
It was used internally in deep layer of [[neural network | neural nets]] but is usually used only as output unit today for binary classification.

### Formula 
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

### Derivative 
$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}z} \sigma(z) = \sigma(z) (1 - \sigma(z))
$$

See [[derivation of sigmoid]].
