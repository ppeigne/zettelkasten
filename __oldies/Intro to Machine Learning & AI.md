Intelligence : 
The hability to do a wide range of things well is a characterisation of intelligence.

Intelligence measures an agent'a ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments


Building an artficial intelligence implies to know what intelligence is.

RL: 
- General Purpose Framework for Ai
- Agent interacts with th environment
- Select actions to maximise long term reward
- Encompasses supervised and unsupervised learning as special cases

2 - AlphaGo and AlphaZero
- Policy network. Takes a position and give a probability for each move to be played from that state of the board.
- Value network: Takes a position and give if it is good for black or white.

Used supervised learning to learn the policy network.
Used the policy net to generate a lot of plays to train the value network (RL).

AlphaZero;
self-play 
- DL enables to search huge search space of complex board games
- Self-Play produces large amounts of data necessary for training the deep neural nets
- self-play provides an automatic curriculum strating from simple opponenets to stronger and stronger oppopents
- system discovers new knowledge
- new directions: learn rules of the game, more than two players, imperfect information, larger action spaces etc

Capture the flag:
each play are on a different map
